# Pookalam 

Pookalam is an intricate and colourful arrangement of flowers laid on the floor. ... 'Pookhalam' consists of two words, 'poov' meaning flower and 'kalam' means colour sketches on the ground. It is considered auspicious to prepare Pookalam, also known as 'Aththa-Poo' during the festival of Onam.

## Code a Pookalam

## Note
The Canvas API provides a means for drawing graphics via JavaScript and the HTML <canvas> element.
